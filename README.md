The goal is to develop a MP3 media player using JavaFX that offers a user-friendly and visually appealing interface for playing MP3 audio files. 

The application allows users to **play**, **pause**, **stop** and **skip** mp3 files, as well as **control the volume** of the audio being played. 

The mp3 files should be stored locally on the user's computer and the application wil be able to play them without any issues. The media player is designed to provide a smooth and efficient user experience for playing mp3 audio files. The focus is on delivering a functional and visually appealing application for playing mp3 files.
